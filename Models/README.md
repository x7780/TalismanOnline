## 🔍 Model Analysis
Models in this directory can be analyzed for:
- **Polygon count** - Model complexity and optimization
- **Texture resolution** - Image quality and performance impact
- **Animation data** - Rigging and skeletal animation information
- **Material properties** - Shaders and surface properties
- **File formats** - .FBX, .OBJ, .3DS, etc.

## 🛠️ Analysis Tools
Common tools for model analysis:
- **Blender** - Open source 3D modeling and analysis
- **3DS Max** - Professional modeling and analysis
- **Maya** - Animation and rigging analysis
- **Unity/Unreal** - Game engine import testing
- **Custom scripts** - Automated batch analysis

## 📊 Optimization Guidelines
When analyzing models, check for:
- Excessive polygon density
- Oversized textures
- Unnecessary material complexity
- Missing LOD (Level of Detail) versions
- Animation efficiency
